///In this script, the PlayerScore class keeps track of the player's score and updates the score text in the UI. 
///It also interacts with the HoleManager script when the player reaches the hole, updating the total score and resetting the player's score.

///To use this script, follow these steps:

///Create a Text UI element for the score display and assign it to the scoreText variable in the Inspector of the player object.
///Attach the PlayerScore script to the player object in the scene.
///Make sure you have a HoleManager script attached to the hole object or a dedicated game manager object.
///Tag the obstacle GameObjects with the tag "Obstacle" so that the script can detect collisions with them.
///Tag the hole GameObject with the tag "Hole" so that the script can detect when the player reaches it.
///Now, when the player collides with an obstacle, the score will increment and update in the UI. 
///When the player reaches the hole, the PlayerScore script will communicate with the HoleManager script to update the total score and reset the player's score.
